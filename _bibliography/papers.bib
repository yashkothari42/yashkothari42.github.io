  abstract  = {This paper asks whether inter-flow contention between congestion control algorithms (CCAs) is a dominant factor in determining a flow's bandwidth allocation in today's Internet. We hypothesize that CCA contention typically does not determine a flow's bandwidth allocation, present an initial analysis in support of this hypothesis, propose a measurement technique and study to settle this question, and discuss the implications should the hypothesis prove true.},

I am a master's student at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, specializing in computer systems, with a focus on analytical database systems and operating systems.
 
I graduated with a bachelor's in mathematics and computer science from <a href="">Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati</a> in 2020, where I conducted research on making neural networks more interpretable under the guidance of <a href="https://www.iitg.ac.in/shbora/">Prof. Shreemayee Bora</a>. 
 
Previously, I worked at <a href="https://www.quadeye.com">Quadeye</a>, a high-frequency trading firm, as a systems engineer developing low-latency systems for quant strategies. I also interned at Samsung Research, working on their AI accelerator platform for mobile devices.

Currently, I'm interning at <a href="https://www.firebolt.io"> Firebolt</a>, a cloud data warehouse, where I am improving the performance of reading data from NVMe using asynchronous methods such as io_uring.

In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I am passionate about movies, board games and technology. I am also a rookie trekker, looking forward to more adventures in the future.

 I am a Master's student at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, specializing in computer systems. I graduated with a B.Tech. in Mathematics and Computing from the <a href="">Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati</a> in 2020. My undergraduate research focused on making neural networks more interpretable with <a href="https://www.iitg.ac.in/shbora/">Prof. Shreemayee Bora</a>. 
 
Previously, I worked at Quadeye, a high-frequency trading firm, as a systems engineer building low-latency systems for quant strategies. I have also interned at Samsung Research, Bangalore, working on their neural accelerator platform for mobile devices.

Apart from my academic and professional pursuits, I have a keen interest in movies, board gaming, and technology. I am also a rookie trekker, looking forward to more adventures in the future.
